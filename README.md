# TaskFlow
TaskFlow is a full-stack project designed to build a task management system from scratch. The first phase of this project focuses on setting up the development environment and deploying a static portfolio website. It acts as a foundational step in a series of progressively complex tasks aimed at mastering modern web development tools and practices.

🔧 Phase 1: Environment Setup
The initial step is to prepare the development workspace with essential tools:

Visual Studio Code (with extensions like Live Server & Prettier)

Git for version control

Node.js and npm for JavaScript runtime and package management

Chrome DevTools for debugging and responsive design

🌐 Phase 2: Building the Portfolio Website
A simple static site is built using HTML and CSS with a responsive design. The structure includes:

3 HTML Pages: Home (index.html), About (about.html), and Contact (contact.html)

CSS Styling using Flexbox, Grid, and media queries

A responsive navigation bar and adaptive layout for mobile and desktop views

🚀 Phase 3: Deployment
Developers deploy the portfolio using one of two methods:

GitHub Pages

Netlify (via drag-and-drop or GitHub integration)

✅ Skills Validation
The project helps validate key frontend skills:

Git commands and version tracking

Semantic HTML5 structure

Responsive design using modern CSS

Static site deployment on the web
